# Hypercubes :tw-1f3b2::tw-1f525:

## Description
This is a Java program that is based on the hypercube connection network for two hypercubes. With this program, you can select a sending node and a receiving node to obtain the shortest path between them.

#### Some improvements that will be implemented in the program are
- Allowing the sending of more than two sending nodes to a receiving node.
- Using threads and concepts of parallel programming to improve the program's efficiency.
- Reducing unnecessary lines of code to make the program easier to understand and maintain.
- Better organizing the classes using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for better structure and organization of the code.
